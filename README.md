A little Notepad made completely in Windows XP, Office 2003 and Visual Basic 6. Why did I choose to do it like that? Just to have some fun!

It was set firstly as a challenge for a friend of mine, but after some time I decided too to take on the challenge of making a notepad, because otherwise I would have felt really bored during summer. It's not an extremely complicated program, but it's basically my first ever Visual Basic application fully developed.
